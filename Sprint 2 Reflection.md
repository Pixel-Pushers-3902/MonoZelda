# Sprint 2 Reflection

Our team demonstrated strong organization and proactivity in meeting the requirements of Sprint 2. As seen on our roadmap, most tasks were completed in a timely manner and were evenly distributed throughout the sprint. The player feature posed the most persistent challenge, as it was the most complex and had dependencies on several other aspects of the sprint.

Communication within the team was effective and frequent. An early implementation of a generic sprite drawing and loading system streamlined and unified sprite handling for the rest of the team. Additionally, the general adoption of the Command Pattern enabled us to integrate new functionality into the project with minimal effort. As our understanding of the pattern evolved, we iterated on its implementation and continue to refine it.

The Keyboard Controller saw considerable activity during the sprint but resisted refactoring due to the constant modifications. As a result, we anticipate a redesign of the Keyboard Controller in Sprint 3, aiming to simplify its interaction with the Command Manager and the command construction process.

Our team held weekly meetings on Monday evenings to share progress and discuss design ideas. We began Sprint 2 by populating a design board with the necessary tasks, which members volunteered to tackle. Throughout the sprint, we communicated effectively, especially when encountering challenges. We made extensive use of pull requests to maintain the quality of the codebase, and GitHub Actions ensured that all pull requests compiled successfully, preventing non-runnable code from being merged.

Looking ahead to Sprint 3, we do not foresee any substantial changes to our process. We plan to start the next sprint in the same manner—by filling the task board with necessary items and dividing up the work amongst team members.

Code reviews occurred organically as pull requests came in, as such, code metrics and code analysis were done in hindsight. We have identified a Github action that will run .Net code quality and style analysis for all pull requests to guarantee we are staying on top of those metrics.
